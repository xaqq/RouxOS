Prerequise:
- You must be root, as we're using losetup to mount the floppy on a loop device.
- an Unix-like system (we mkdir -p /mnt/loop & using /dev/loop0)
- g++ / gcc / nasm / make / m4
- qemu-kvm (or qemu, see change scripts/test.sh)

I) Howto test the kernel:
- Make sure you have "floppyA". If you don't, jump to II.
- Simply run "make test". This will remake the kernel then mount it.
